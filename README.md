I deployed a simple web application on multiple virtual machines and configured a load balancer to distribute incoming traffic. An auto scaling group was created to automatically launch or terminate instances based on CPU utilization. When the load increased, new instances were created; when it decreased, unused ones were removed — ensuring performance and cost efficiency.
